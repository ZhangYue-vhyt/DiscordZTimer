# Z-Timer
Since other timer can not set the start time at a specific time, I decided to create this bot.
# Usage
**The format of time must be YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM/SS**

Set a timer.
```sh
timer [#channel]|[@user] [content] [start time] [interval] [repeat time]|[end time]
```
Check all timers.
```sh
timer ls
```
Check a timer.
```sh
timer stat [timer ID]
```
Remove a timer.
```sh
timer rm [timer ID]
```
